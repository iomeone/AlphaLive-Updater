# AlphaLive Updater #

AlphaLive Updater is a simple GUI utility application that installs software updates for [AlphaLive](http://www.alphasphere.com/alphalive/), the [AlphaSphere](http://www.alphasphere.com/)'s official software application. It has been designed to be launched directly from AlphaLive, and takes the update data that was downloaded through AlphaLive and moves all the files to the correct places. 

AlphaLive Updater has been programmed using the [JUCE](http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce.php) cross-platform C++ library, and includes an Xcode project for building on Mac OS X, a Visual Studio 2010 project for building on Windows, and a makefile for building on Linux.
